# TriageAI: 6-Minute Investor Pitch Video Script

## I. Overall Video Production & Delivery Guidance

*   **Pacing:** Keep a brisk, energetic pace without rushing. You have a lot to cover in 6 minutes, so every second counts.
*   **Tone:** Be confident, passionate, and professional. You're not just presenting a project; you're selling a vision.
*   **Recording Environment:**
    *   **Audio:** Use a high-quality microphone. Poor audio is a major distraction. Record in a quiet room to avoid background noise.
    *   **Lighting:** Ensure your face is well-lit from the front. Avoid backlighting (e.g., sitting with a window behind you).
    *   **Background:** Use a clean, professional background. It could be a simple wall, a bookshelf, or a virtual background with the TriageAI logo.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   **Mix it up:** Combine talking head shots with screen recordings, animations, and on-screen text to keep the video engaging.
    *   **High-Quality Screen Recordings:** Record your prototype in high resolution. Use a tool that can highlight clicks and mouse movements.
    *   **On-Screen Text:** Use bold, easy-to-read fonts. Animate text to appear as you mention the key points.
*   **Editing:**
    *   **Cut between shots:** Switch between the talking head and the demo to maintain viewer interest.
    *   **Add background music:** A subtle, professional background track can enhance the video's feel.
    *   **Practice, practice, practice:** Rehearse the script multiple times to ensure a smooth, natural delivery.

## II. The 6-Minute Video Script

### **Part 1: The Hook (0:00 - 0:30)**

**(Visuals: Start with a fast-paced montage of stock footage showing a crowded, chaotic hospital waiting room. Patients looking stressed, clocks ticking, overworked staff. End on a shot of you, the presenter, looking directly at the camera.)**

**You (Presenter):** (Energetic, confident)
"Every year, millions of hours are wasted in waiting rooms. Patients get sicker, doctors burn out, and clinics lose money. The problem isn't the quality of care; it's the outdated, inefficient system that manages it. My name is [Your Name], and we've built the solution to fix this."

**(On-screen text: TriageAI logo fades in and out.)**

---

### **Part 2: The Problem (0:30 - 1:30)**

**(Visuals: Switch to a clean, animated infographic style. Use icons and bold text to represent the key problems.)**

**You (Presenter, voice-over):**
"The current patient intake process is broken. It's manual, slow, and riddled with inefficiencies."

**(On-screen text/animation: "The Waiting Room Nightmare")**

"First, patients face excruciatingly long wait times, leading to frustration and worsening conditions."

**(On-screen text/animation: "Long Wait Times" with a ticking clock icon.)**

"Second, the triage process is subjective and time-consuming, leading to inconsistent assessments and delays."

**(On-screen text/animation: "Inefficient Triage" with a clipboard and question mark icon.)**

"Finally, patients are often assigned to the next available doctor, not the right doctor for their specific needs. This leads to misdiagnosis, wasted resources, and a poor patient experience."

**(On-screen text/animation: "Suboptimal Doctor-Patient Matching" with a mismatched puzzle piece icon.)**

"This isn't just a patient problem; it's a multi-billion dollar operational inefficiency that directly impacts a clinic's bottom line."

---

### **Part 3: The Solution & Live Demo (1:30 - 3:30)**

**(Visuals: Transition back to you, the presenter. You're enthusiastic and ready to show the solution.)**

**You (Presenter):**
"Introducing TriageAI: an intelligent platform that revolutionizes clinic operations from the moment a patient walks in. Let me show you how it works."

**(Visuals: Seamlessly transition to a high-quality screen recording of the PatientKiosk.tsx view.)**

**You (Presenter, voice-over):**
"It starts here, at the Patient Kiosk. A patient checks in and is greeted by 'Nurse Ada,' our multimodal AI assistant."

**(Demo: Show the patient check-in process and the start of the "Nurse Ada" interaction.)**

**You (Presenter, voice-over):**
"Using Google's latest Gemini 2.5 Flash model, Nurse Ada has a natural, real-time conversation with the patient, using voice and video to understand their symptoms and medical history. This isn't a clunky chatbot; it's a truly empathetic and intelligent virtual nurse."

**(Visuals: Switch to the DoctorDashboard.tsx view. The newly triaged patient appears at the top of the queue.)**

**You (Presenter, voice-over):**
"Once triage is complete, our AI-powered assignment engine gets to work. It analyzes every doctor's specialty, workload, and the patient's needs to make the optimal assignment in milliseconds. The patient appears in the correct doctor's queue."

**(Demo: Click on the patient in the doctor's queue to open the PatientChartPanel. Highlight the AI-generated triage summary.)**

**You (Presenter, voice-over):**
"The doctor receives a concise, structured summary of the triage, saving them critical time. But we go a step further. TriageAI provides 'AI Insights'—a list of potential diagnoses and recommended actions, turning our system into a powerful clinical decision support tool."

**(Visuals: Switch to the AdminDashboard.tsx view.)**

**You (Presenter, voice-over):**
"And for administrators, our Command Center provides a real-time overview of the entire clinic's operations. You can monitor patient flow, wait times, and doctor utilization, and even manage staff on the fly. This is the end of operational guesswork."

### **Part 4: The Magic (Technology) (3:30 - 4:30)**

**(Visuals: Transition to a slick animation showing the TriageAI logo in the center with data flowing between three key pillars.)**

**You (Presenter, voice-over):**
"So, how do we make this happen? Our 'magic' lies in three core technological pillars."

**(On-screen text/animation: Pillar 1 - "Multimodal Conversational AI")**

"First, our 'Nurse Ada' uses Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for state-of-the-art multimodal triage, providing a deeply human-like interaction."

**(On-screen text/animation: Pillar 2 - "Intelligent Assignment Engine")**

"Second, our proprietary assignment engine, powered by a cost-minimization algorithm, ensures patients are always matched with the best-suited doctor."

**(On-screen text/animation: Pillar 3 - "AI-Augmented Decision Support")**

"And third, our system provides doctors with AI-powered insights, elevating TriageAI from a simple logistics tool to a true clinical partner."

---

### **Part 5: Market & Business Model (4:30 - 5:30)**

**(Visuals: Quick, impactful graphics with large numbers.)**

**You (Presenter, voice-over):**
"We are targeting the AI-powered patient triage market, a **1.45 billion dollar** industry today, projected to grow to over **11 billion by 2033**."

**(On-screen text: "$1.45B in 2024 -> $11.89B by 2033")**

"Our business model is simple and scalable: a recurring subscription for our platform, plus a small, usage-based fee per patient. This ensures our revenue grows alongside the value we deliver."

**(On-screen text: "SaaS Subscription + Usage-Based Fee")**

---

### **Part 6: The Ask & Closing (5:30 - 6:00)**

**(Visuals: Transition back to you, the presenter, for the final closing statement. Look directly at the camera with conviction.)**

**You (Presenter):**
"We have a working prototype, a massive market opportunity, and a clear path to revenue. We are seeking [Your Ask - e.g., '$500,000 in seed funding'] to scale our development, integrate with major EHR systems, and onboard our first pilot clinics."

**(On-screen text: "The Ask: [Your Ask]")**

"TriageAI is more than just a software platform; it's the future of efficient, intelligent, and patient-centric healthcare. Let's build it together."

**(Visuals: End with the TriageAI logo and your contact information (email, website) on a clean background.)**
